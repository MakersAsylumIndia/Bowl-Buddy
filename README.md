## 🧠 What did we work on 

Cricket bowlers lack a way to improve an integral part of their bowling quality: their line and length. This project aims to give bowlers visual feedback on where they have bowled and where they should bowl depending on certain circumstances.
Our solution involves a mat that is divided into a grid of squares where each square represents a spot for the bowler to bowl. Using information from our user our app will calculate where the user should bowl and accordingly light up the LEDs of that square. Using piezo-electric sensors, we will detect where the user has actually bowled and help him/her improve through a gamified system or simple advice

## 🛠 Where we Documented Everything Else

We’ve already created a standard set of [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/MakersAsylumIndia/Bowl-Buddy/wiki) for your project in this repository — you just need to **update them with your project information**.

Each section is ready with headings like:

- Project Title
- Problem Statement
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Solution Overview
- SDG Goals Associated
- Circuit & CAD Files
- Media Gallery
- License

Please **do not delete the headings** — just replace the placeholder content under each.
